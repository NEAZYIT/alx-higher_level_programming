## Description
This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate various input/output operations in Python, including reading and writing files, JSON serialization, and more.

## Requirements

- Python Scripts
  - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
  - All your files should end with a new line
  - The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
  - Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)

  - All your files should end with a new line
  - All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
  - All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
  - All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
  - All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
  - All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
  - All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
