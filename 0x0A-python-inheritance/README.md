## Description

This project focuses on inheritance, a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. It includes tasks that require implementing classes and methods, validating input data, and exploring the relationships between classes and objects.

## Requirements

- Python Scripts
  - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
  - All your files should end with a new line
  - The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
  - Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
  - All your files must be executable
  - The length of your files will be tested using wc

- Python Test Cases
  - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - All your files should end with a new line
  - All your test files should be inside a folder tests
  - All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
  - All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`

## Tasks

The project includes several tasks related to inheritance and object-oriented programming. These tasks involve creating classes, implementing methods, and validating input data. Below is a brief overview of the tasks:

1. **Lookup**: Write a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object.

2. **My List**: Implement a class `MyList` that inherits from the list class and includes a method to print the sorted list.

3. **Same Class or Inherit From**: Write a function that checks if an object is an instance of, or inherits from, a specified class.

4. **Only Sub Class Of**: Write a function that checks if an object is an instance of a class that inherits from a specified class.

5. **Geometry Module**: Create an empty class `BaseGeometry`.

6. **Improve Geometry**: Enhance the `BaseGeometry` class by adding an `area` method that raises an exception.

7. **Integer Validator**: Extend the `BaseGeometry` class with an `integer_validator` method to validate integer values.

8. **Rectangle**: Create a class `Rectangle` that inherits from `BaseGeometry` and validates width and height.

9. **Full Rectangle**: Extend the `Rectangle` class to include an `area` method and a custom string representation.

10. **Square #1**: Implement a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle` and has a size attribute.

11. **Square #2**: Enhance the `Square` class to include a custom string representation.
