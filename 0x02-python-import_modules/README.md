# Higher Level Programming - Python

Welcome to the Higher Level Programming Python repository! This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that cover various topics in Python programming, including importing modules, command-line arguments, basic operations, and more. Each script serves as an example of a specific concept.

## Table of Contents

1. [Importing a Simple Function](./0x02-python-import_modules/0-add.py): A program that imports the `add` function from the `add_0.py` file and demonstrates its usage.

2. [My First Toolbox](./0x02-python-import_modules/1-calculation.py): A program that imports functions from `calculator_1.py` and performs basic mathematical operations.

3. [Dynamic Script](./0x02-python-import_modules/2-args.py): A program that displays the number of arguments provided and lists them.

4. [Infinite Addition](./0x02-python-import_modules/3-infinite_add.py): A program that calculates the sum of all provided arguments.

5. [Hidden Names](./0x02-python-import_modules/4-hidden_discovery.py): A program that prints the names defined in the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.

6. [Variable Import](./0x02-python-import_modules/5-variable_load.py): A program that imports a variable from `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value.

7. [Build a Calculator](./0x02-python-import_modules/100-my_calculator.py): A program that imports functions from `calculator_1.py` and performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.

8. [Easy Print](./0x02-python-import_modules/101-easy_print.py): A program that prints `#pythoniscool` without using `print` or other prohibited statements.

9. [Magic Calculation](./0x02-python-import_modules/102-magic_calculation.py): A Python function that performs calculations similar to a given Python bytecode.

10. [Fast Alphabet](./0x02-python-import_modules/103-fast_alphabet.py): A program that prints the alphabet in uppercase using a concise approach.

## Requirements

- All scripts are developed and tested using Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Scripts adhere to PEP8 style guidelines using pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- Each script is executable and includes the shebang `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file is included at the root of the project folder, providing information about the repository and its contents.

Feel free to explore the scripts to learn more about different aspects of Python programming!

**Note:** Some scripts may have advanced features and requirements. Please refer to the specific script's section in the README for details.
