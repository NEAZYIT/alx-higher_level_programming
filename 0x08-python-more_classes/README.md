# Rectangle Class

## Description

This Python project defines a `Rectangle` class with various attributes and methods for working with rectangles. The class includes features such as calculating the area and perimeter of a rectangle, changing its representation, and more.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks

### Task 0: Simple Rectangle

Write an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.

### Task 1: Real definition of a rectangle

Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with private instance attributes `width` and `height`, and methods to set and retrieve these attributes.

### Task 2: Area and Perimeter

Extend the `Rectangle` class to include methods for calculating the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

### Task 3: String representation

Add methods to the `Rectangle` class for string representation, ensuring that rectangles are printed using the character '#'.

### Task 4: Eval is magic

Extend the `Rectangle` class to include methods for evaluation and string representation that allow recreating a new instance using `eval()`.

### Task 5: Detect instance deletion

Add a method to the `Rectangle` class that prints a message when an instance is deleted.

### Task 6: How many instances

Create a class attribute `number_of_instances` to keep track of the number of instances created from the `Rectangle` class.

### Task 7: Change representation

Add a class attribute `print_symbol` to change the character used for string representation.

### Task 8: Compare rectangles

Implement a static method `bigger_or_equal` that compares two rectangles and returns the one with the larger area.

### Task 9: A square is a rectangle

Add a class method `square` to create a new `Rectangle` instance where the width and height are equal, creating a square.

## Usage

You can use the provided test files and scripts to test the functionality of the `Rectangle` class and its various methods.
