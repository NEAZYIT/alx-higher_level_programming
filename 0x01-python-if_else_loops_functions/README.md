# Higher Level Programming - Python

This repository contains Python scripts and C scripts that cover various topics related to higher level programming, including if-else statements, loops, functions, and more.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project, is mandatory
- Code should use the PEP 8 style guide (pycodestyle version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- File lengths will be tested using `wc`

### C Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- Code should use the Betty style
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in a header file called `lists.h`
- Header files should be include guarded

## Tasks

### Task 0: Positive or Negative

Python script that assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. It then prints whether the number stored in the variable is positive, negative, or zero.

### Task 1: The Last Digit

Python script that assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. It then prints the last digit of the number and additional information based on the last digit.

### Task 2: Print Alphabet

Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

### Task 3: Print Alphabet Without q and e

Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', not followed by a new line.

### Task 4: Hexadecimal Printing

Python script that prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal formats.

### Task 5: 00...99

Python script that prints numbers from 0 to 99, separated by commas and spaces.

### Task 6: Combinations

Python script that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

### Task 7: islower

Python function that checks if a character is lowercase.

### Task 8: To Uppercase

Python function that prints a string in uppercase.

### Task 9: Print Last Digit

Python function that prints the last digit of a number.

### Task 10: a + b

Python function that adds two integers and returns the result.

### Task 11: a ^ b

Python function that computes a to the power of b and returns the result.

### Task 12: Fizz Buzz

Python function that prints numbers from 1 to 100, with specific replacements for multiples of 3, 5, and both 3 and 5.

### Task 13: Insert in Sorted Linked List

C function that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

### Task 14: Smile in the Mirror

Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet in reverse order, alternating between lowercase and uppercase.

### Task 15: Remove at Position

Python function that creates a copy of a string, removing the character at a specific position.

### Task 16: ByteCode to Python #2

Python function `magic_calculation` that performs the same operations as given bytecode.

## Usage

For each task, there is a corresponding Python or C script that can be executed directly. Make sure to read the task description and requirements before running the scripts.
