# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

The project aims to develop a Square class in Python that provides functionalities for working with squares. The class allows users to create square objects, manipulate their attributes such as size and position, calculate their area, and print them in a visually appealing way. It emphasizes encapsulation and follows object-oriented programming principles to ensure proper control and validation of square attributes. The project also emphasizes the importance of documentation, providing comprehensive docstrings for each module, class, and method. By completing this project, learners will gain a solid understanding of classes, encapsulation, and object-oriented design in Python.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.\*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of it will be verified)
